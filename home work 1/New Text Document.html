        I was worried, I was stressed
        How did it even feel to be blessed
        I had forgotten the peace inside
        My heart, my chest felt really tight

        But then I asked for help from God
        Desperate, but with all the faith I got
        I looked up to find a clue
        What I saw was nothing new. 

        What I saw was just a regular cloud
        Nothing special, nothing to talk about
        But I noticed how it was floating there
        Against a background of just bluish air

        While the cloud hid the sun from sight
        It kept moving and soon I saw the light
        Now that floating cloud has moved away
        And I see the brightest light of day.

        And here I became suddenly aware 
        That my stressors and worries were still there. 
        The cloud however made me see
        That these problems will not for ever be with me

        Solutions I will search for and I will see the light
        And my heart became calm, it will be all right.
