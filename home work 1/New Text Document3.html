         <h1>Top 10 Technology Trends in 2020</h1>
         <h5>2020/01/02 From <mark>Alibaba DAMO Academy</mark></h5> 



         <p>Today, Alibaba DAMO Academy published The Top 10 Technology Trends in 2020. We hope that by grasping the pace of revolution of technologies, we can make better use of these “magics” and be in charge of our own future.</p>


         <h4>Trend No 1.  Artificial intelligence evolves from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence</h4>

         <p>Artificial intelligence has reached or surpassed humans in the areas of perceptual intelligence such as speech to text, natural language processing, video understanding etc; but in the field of cognitive intelligence that requires external knowledge, logical reasoning, or domain migration, it is still in its infancy. Cognitive intelligence will draw inspiration from cognitive psychology, brain science, and human social history, combined with techniques such as cross domain knowledge graph, causality inference, and continuous learning to establish effective mechanisms for stable acquisition and expression of knowledge. These make machines to understand and utilize knowledge, achieving key breakthroughs from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence.</p><br>
         <h4>Trend No 2. In-Memory-Computing addresses the "memory wall" challenges in AI computing</h4>

         <p>In Von Neumann architecture, memory and processor are separate and the computation requires data to be moved back and forth. With the rapid development of data-driven AI algorithms in recent years, it has come to a point where the hardware becomes the bottleneck in the explorations of more advanced algorithms. In Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architecture, in contrast to the Von Neumann architecture, memory and processor are fused together and computations are performed where data is stored with minimal data movement. As such, computation parallelism and power efficiency can be significantly improved. We believe the innovations on PIM architecture are the tickets to next generation AI.</p> <br>
